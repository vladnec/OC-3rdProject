# OC-3rdProject
Third Project for OpenClassRooms "Junior Web Dev" path.
Scenario

You are starting to get more recognition online thanks to your resume on Github Pages. Clients are flooding in, but they always ask the same questions: they want to see more of your work.

Why not build an online portfolio? 

For this project, you will build on the resume that you've already integrated online. You need to add new pages to showcase your work, and this will require a navigation bar.
